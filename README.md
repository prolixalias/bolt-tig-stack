## About Bolt

Bolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it
takes to maintain your infrastructure. Use Bolt to automate tasks that you
perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow.
For example, you can use Bolt to patch and update systems, troubleshoot servers,
deploy applications, or stop and restart services. Bolt can be installed on your
local workstation and connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so
you are not required to install any agent software.

For more information, see the [Bolt repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt).
